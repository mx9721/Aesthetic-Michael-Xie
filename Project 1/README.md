This project is inspired by the Truchet Pattern shown in class, it seemed to be relatively simple but also able to create a lot of interesting patterns that seems to be ever repeating. But it was not simple at all as I was implementing this pattern. While it seems to be a relatively simple pattern but getting the pattern to be continues throughout the entire pattern was a challenge, this retricted me to having pattern that either has connection points in the center of each edge or at each corners. I chose the latter because I thought I will be able to create more interesting patterns. Some technical issues I ran into was getting the right pattern, at first I tried to make some very interesting bezier curves but getting the math right was not a good process so I had to dumb down my idea just so I had enough time to complete my vision, in the end I went with a repeating pattern that uses the 4 corners x to create a circlular pattern of sorts. I also added some decoration in the center of the tile to decorate it a little bit. but overall I think the end product is relatively nice looking with some complexity that I loved.
